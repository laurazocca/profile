        <p>
          I'm 29, born and raised in London UK.
          I've worked in hospitality and restaurant management but have always had a passion for music,
          and have pursued it alongside my various hospitality jobs from the age of 18 to 24.
          Back in 2020 I decided to do music full time, and succesfully managed to make it my full time job for the last 3 years.
          That being said, front end coding has always been something that intrigued me and that i've dabbled in,
          so I decided to start something totally different where I could still be creative,
          just in a completely new way. That lead me to Le Wagon and the web dev bootcamp!
