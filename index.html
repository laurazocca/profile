        <p>
          I'm 29, born and raised in London UK.
          I've worked in hospitality and restaurant management but have always had a passion for music,
          and have pursued it alongside my various hospitality jobs from the age of 18 to 24.
          Back in 2020 I decided to do music full time, and succesfully managed to make it my full time job for the last 3 years.
          As much as I loved doing it full time, and I hit a lot of milestones I never thought i'd reach, the constant need for content creation
          when working in the music industry, was just too much on my mental health. 
          That being said, front end coding has always been something that intrigued me and that i've dabbled in,
          so late last year I decided to start something totally different where I could still be creative,
          just in a completely new way. That lead me to Le Wagon and the web dev bootcamp!
